Learning to Code

Hello,

I am the SupaFappa! A title I am awarding myself with due to years of dedicated practice to the Art of Fapping! 
I am here to learn how to code. I played around with it years ago and have forgot just about everything. Coding seems like something I would enjoy. In the spare time I have between practicing and performing my many Fap sessions that is.
So lets get this learning business started.
